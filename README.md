# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Ali

I'm a higher secondary (+1) student and freelance web designer focused on building clean, responsive websites and learning real-world software skills. I completed the IIT Madras School Connect Program in Data Science and AI, which introduced me to the IITM BS curriculum concepts.

I have a strong foundation in C, C++, and Java, and I'm building practical experience with JavaScript and Python through small projects and problem-solving practice. I've been actively learning and building projects for almost two years, focusing on writing clean code, understanding fundamentals, and applying concepts in real projects.

Right now, I'm improving my frontend development skills and learning the fundamentals of full-stack development and cybersecurity. I like working on practical projects, contributing to open-source when I can, and using Git daily to track and improve my work. My goal is to build reliable, useful tools and grow into a strong developer through consistent practice and real project experience.
